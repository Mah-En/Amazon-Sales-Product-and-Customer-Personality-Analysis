## 🛠️ Methods

### 🔍 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and duplicates
- Normalized formats
- Feature engineering: Aggregated sales per month, income brackets, etc.

### 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
Used pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to:
- Understand distributions
- Reveal customer behavior patterns
- Identify seasonality and trends

### 📊 Statistical Testing
- **Shapiro-Wilk** and **Kolmogorov-Smirnov** tests confirmed non-normality of the data.
- These tests justified the use of non-parametric methods in follow-up analysis.
